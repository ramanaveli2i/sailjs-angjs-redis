# Angular Messages

`Angular Messages` is a demo application to show how to implement `JWT` authentication with a `Sails` backend and an `Angular` frontend.

If you want to try it, you need to do the following:

Install the latest `sails` beta if you don't have it:

```
$ sudo npm install -g sails@beta
```

Then, inside this app folder:

```
$ npm install
$ sails lift
```

Register yourself and write some messages.

### TODO:

* Socket.io integration.
* Maybe different levels of authorization (i.e admin).
* Token expiration.
* Write a proper article about JWT and another about this demo.
